# termux-api-pydantic

A nice termux api for modern python versions because i couldn't be bothered to support them and it also depends on a fat package, yay!! (really, use this only if you dont care the pydantic package overhead and import time penalty, or you already use it AND you use python version 3.12 or above)

```py
import termux_api_pydantic as tmx
```
